# Fingerprint For Auth0 Marketplace

The Fingerprint and Okta Customer Identity Cloud (CIC) powered by Auth0 integration is designed to provide a unique identifier for each of your user's devices. This is a powerful signal that helps reduce fraud and improve the user experience. 

The integration is powered by Fingerprint Pro's device detection technology, which is an industry-leading solution that quickly and accurately identifies the characteristics of a browser or device. The device information, with unparalleled accuracy, is then used to create a unique and immutable device fingerprint that can be used to securely identify a user's device and detect any malicious activity.
